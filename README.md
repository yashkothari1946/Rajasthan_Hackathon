## ARAlpha

<p>Our Idea is using Augmented Reality to build an efficient system to make learning more effective for the students. We have built an android app for the same. The interface of the application allows the user to view and interact with  a complete 3-D image of an object formed with the help of augmented reality. This can be done by just focussing on the image of a word.
For example, if the user focuses the camera on a word , he will be able to view a complete virtual 3-D image of that. Moreover , the user will be able to control the movements of it to have a complete feel of the thing. 
With the help of this android app , the pre primary students will be able to analyse the objects properly ,thus making the learning real fun.</p>
